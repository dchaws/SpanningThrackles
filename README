The program numspanthrackles impliments my conjectured recursive function
for the number of spanning thrackles of a complete bipartite graph.

Let f(m,n) = number of spanning thrackles of the complete bipartite graph.

Then, I conjecture f(m,n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(m-1,n-i).

I think this follows from the fact that if we order the vertices


m *     * m+1

...   

3 *     * m+n-2
2 *     * m+n-1
1 *     * m+n


If we require the edge {1,m+1} and no other edges incident to 1, then this
reduces to f(m-1,n).
